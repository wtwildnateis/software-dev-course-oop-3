## Introduction

In this exercise, you will be completing a project that simulates a management system for a media collection.
The `Main` class providing a menu system for the user is already implemented, but the `LibraryItem` class and its
subclasses `Album`, `Movie`, and `Book` need to be created and implemented.

> [!NOTE]
> The current project will not build or run, and tests will not run properly until you have completed the exercise.

## Creating the Base Class `LibraryItem`

The first class that you will need to create is the `LibraryItem` class.  This class will be the base class for the
`Album`, `Movie`, and `Book` classes, and need to contain the following `protected` fields:

| Property | Type   | Description                            |
|----------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| title    | String | The title of the item                  |
| year     | int    | The year the item was released         |
| author   | String | The author of the item (if applicable) |

The `LibraryItem` class should also contain the following methods:

| Method        | Arguments                                         | Return Type  | Description                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `LibraryItem` | `title` (String), `year` (int), `author` (String) | None         | Constructor that initializes the fields of the class   |
| `toString`    | None                                              | String       | Returns a string representation of the item            |
| `getTitle`    | None                                              | String       | Returns the title of the item (getter method)          |
| `getYear`     | None                                              | int          | Returns the year the item was released (getter method) |
| `getAuthor`   | None                                              | String       | Returns the author of the item (getter method)         |

For your `toString` method, return a string formatted as follows:

```
Item: <title> by <author> (<year>)
```

## Creating the `Album` Subclass

The `Album` class is a subclass of the `LibraryItem` class and should contain the following additiohnal `protected` fields:

| Property   | Type    | Description                             |
|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| trackCount | int     | The number of tracks on the album       |

You should also include an accessor method for the `trackCount` field:

| Method          | Arguments    | Return Type | Description                                               |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `getTrackCount` | None         | int         | Returns the number of tracks on the album (getter method) |

You will also need to implement a constructor that accepts the same arguments as the `LibraryItem` constructor, as well as
an additional argument for the `trackCount` field.  Remember to call the superclass constructor to initialize the fields of the
`LibraryItem` class, using the `super` keyword.

Finally, you will need to override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Album` object.  The string

You should override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Album` object in the following format:

```
Album: <title> by <author> (<year>) - <trackCount> tracks
```

| Method          | Arguments                                                             | Return Type  | Description                                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Album`         | `title` (String), `year` (int), `author` (String), `trackCount` (int) | None         | Constructor that initializes the fields of the class       |
| `toString`      | None                                                                  | String       | Returns a string representation of the album               |


## Creawting the `Movie` Subclass

The `Movie` class is a subclass of the `LibraryItem` class and should contain the following additional `protected` fields:

| Property          | Type    | Description                             |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| durationInMinutes | int     | The duration of the movie in minutes    |

You should also include an accessor method for the `durationInMinutes` field:

| Method                  | Arguments    | Return Type | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getDurationInMinutes`  | None         | int         | Returns the duration of the movie in minutes (getter method) |

You will also need to implement a constructor that accepts the same arguments as the `LibraryItem` constructor, as well as
an additional argument for the `durationInMinutes` field.  Remember to call the superclass constructor to initialize the fields of the
`LibraryItem` class, using the `super` keyword.

Finally, you will need to override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Movie` object.  The string

You should override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Movie` object in the following format:

```
Movie: <title> by <author> (<year>) - <durationInMinutes> minutes
```

| Method          | Arguments                                                                    | Return Type  | Description                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Movie`         | `title` (String), `year` (int), `author` (String), `durationInMinutes` (int) | None         | Constructor that initializes the fields of the class        |
| `toString`      | None                                                                         | String       | Returns a string representation of the movie                |

## Creating the `Book` Subclass

The `Book` class is a subclass of the `LibraryItem` class and should contain the following additional `protected` fields:

| Property   | Type    | Description                             |
|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| pageCount  | int     | The number of pages in the book         |

You should also include an accessor method for the `pageCount` field:

| Method          | Arguments    | Return Type | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getPageCount`  | None         | int         | Returns the number of pages in the book (getter method)      |

You will also need to implement a constructor that accepts the same arguments as the `LibraryItem` constructor, as well as
an additional argument for the `pageCount` field.  Remember to call the superclass constructor to initialize the fields of the
`LibraryItem` class, using the `super` keyword.

Finally, you will need to override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Book` object.  The string

You should override the `toString` method to return a string representation of the `Book` object in the following format:

```java
"Book: <title> by <author> (<year>) - <pageCount> pages"
```

| Method          | Arguments                                                             | Return Type  | Description                                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Book`          | `title` (String), `year` (int), `author` (String), `pageCount` (int) | None         | Constructor that initializes the fields of the class       |
| `toString`      | None                                                                  | String       | Returns a string representation of the book                |

In the book class, we are going to add one more method specific to `Book`s only.  This method will be called
`readBook`, and will take no arguments and return nothing (`void`).  The method should simply print out the following
message to the console:

```
Reading <title> by <author>...
Done!
```
